This is the response data sent to the attesting machine when it
starts up.  In this version the node expects to find a few different
files:

* `rootfs.key`: The secret key used to unlock the main disk
* `startup`: A shell script (or executable) to be run before trying to boot.
It will be measured into PCR14 before being execution.
* Extra args for the kernel command line?
* Extra files to install?
* Re-install flags?
* Etc
